# Mockingbird Geolocation Module

The Mockingbird Geolocation Module adds geolocation functionality to [the Mockingbird Data Environment](https://github.com/emaloney/MBDataEnvironment).

If you wish to use a dependency manager, [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is supported. Just add the following line to your `Cartfile`, then run `carthage update`:

```
github "emaloney/MBGeolocation" ~> 2.0.0  
```

Otherwise, you may embed `MBGeolocation.xcodeproj` (along with the necessary dependencies) within your own project and link against the appropriate frameworks for your target platform.
